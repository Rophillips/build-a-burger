# Build-A-Burger

## Description

This application demonstrates a simple full stack application with a front end implemented with HTML/CSS and elements from the Materialize framework and the backend implemented with Node.js and Express. HTML templating is done with the help of Handlebars.

The user may enter any burger name to add it to the menu. This also adds the new burger entry into the MySQL database. The initial burger entry is added as available on the menu and placed in the "burgers to devour". Click on "eat the burger" and the burger is placed in the "burgers you've devoured". Then the user can click on the "I'm full" button and the burger is placed back to the "burgers to devour" menu. The user can also delete the burger altogether. 
ENJOY YOUR BURGER!!!
